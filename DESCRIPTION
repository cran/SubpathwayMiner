Description: SubpathwayMiner is an R-based software for flexible
        pathway identification. (1) SubpathwayMiner can provide users
        with sub-pathway annotation and identification of metabolic
        pathways based on enzyme commission (EC) numbers. (2)
        SubpathwayMiner can provide users with sub-pathway annotation
        and identification based on KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers.
        (new!) (3) SubpathwayMiner can provide annotation and
        identification of entire pathways. (4) SubpathwayMiner can
        support most of organisms in the KEGG GENE database. (5) Data
        can be automatically updated on demand by the user.
