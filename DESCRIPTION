Description: SubpathwayMiner is an R-based software for flexible
        pathway identification. (1) SubpathwayMiner can provide users
        with sub-pathway annotation and identification of metabolic
        pathways based on enzyme commission (EC) numbers. (2)
        SubpathwayMiner can provide users with sub-pathway annotation
        and identification based on KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers.
        (3) SubpathwayMiner can provide annotation and identification
        of entire pathways. (4) SubpathwayMiner can support most of
        organisms in the KEGG GENE database. (5) Data can be
        automatically updated on demand by the user. (6)
        SubpathwayMiner can provide identification of disease related
        sub-pathways.
